    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based
        dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions,
        olives,
        pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small
        pizza is
        sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>
